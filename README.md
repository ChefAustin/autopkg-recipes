## Slacker PostProcessor

This requires requests to be installed:
```
pip install requests
```
This is based on the Slack notification post-processor for AutoPkg/JSSImporter that Graham Pugh created:

### Customising notifications:
Change the following values to match your environment.
```
CHANNEL = "macs-notifications"
AUTOPKGICON = "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/5170557?s=200&v=4"
USERNAME = "AutoPKG"
```
